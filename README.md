# 🎨 Personal Portfolio

![mockup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95760ac-8846-434a-b2de-63f1dfe5d3e1)

A simple site to showcase the art I've made over the years. Check it out at [afn.im](https://afn.im/).

I decided I needed to finally rewrite my site after staring at my horrid old codebase and design for so long. Made using SvelteKit and SCSS.
